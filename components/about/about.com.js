                        always happy with myself even during the difficult times that's why my friends and family still
                        don't understand who i am, life has given me 19+ years of experience that i'm not in a hurry to forget
                        on thing that made me more happy was when i started programming in 2020 before the pandemic i learnt HTML
                        and CSS then built my first page from there i began learning more on programming and today i'm able 
                        to build a full web application from scratch it's wonderful to just have this power in my hands and computer
                        everyday i wish i could build applications.
